Hello again 👋
+ This is a step by step tutorial on how to handle the problem of imbalanced datasets for classification machine learning tasks with tabular data, and how these models are evaluated
+ Solutions to handle imbalanced datasets are outlined, as well as their limitations
+ The confusion matrix is explained, built and other evaluation metrics derived from it
+ I've also included a gentle introduction to tuning the decision threshold of `ROC` curves
+ Comments, working code and links to the latest official documentation are included every step of the way
+ Feel free to build upon these concepts


## Milestones 🏁

## Tools ⚒️
1. [`Google Colab`](https://colab.google/) - A hosted Jupyter Notebook service by Google.
2. [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) - A comprehensive library for making static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
3. [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) - An open-source data analysis and manipulation tool built on Python
4. [`imblearn`](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/index.html) - A free and open-source Python library relying on [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#) that provides tools for dealing with classification problems that have imblanced classes   
5. [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/#) - A free open-source library that offers machine learning tools for the Python programming language
